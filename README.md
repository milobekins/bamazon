# bamazon

The purpose of this project is to construct an Amazon-like command line interface application, utilizing mySQL concepts learned in class.

The project utilizes Node.js, mySQL, and the following node modules:

-inquirer
-mysql
-console.table

Prior to use of the application, one must run the included schema.sql file on a properly connected local server. Servernames and passwords must then be updated on each of the .js files. npm install must also be run in the terminal, to install necessary node module files.
